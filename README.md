## Chap 1 : Architecture Overview

In the world of software, there exists a system known as Odoo, which follows a multitier structure. It resembles a grand castle with three distinct layers: the presentation tier, the logic tier, and the data tier. üè∞

![Texte alternatif](docs/images/architechture.png)

In this castle, the presentation tier is like the castle's exterior, made of HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS. It's what visitors see and interact with. The logic tier, however, is like the castle's intricate machinery, all written in Python. This layer handles the castle's inner workings, ensuring everything runs smoothly. Lastly, the data tier, akin to the castle's vault, stores all the important information using PostgreSQL as its guardian. üõ°Ô∏è

Now, within this castle, developers roam freely, crafting extensions called modules. Each module is like a special chamber dedicated to a specific purpose. Some modules add new features to the castle, while others extend existing functionalities. Imagine one module adding magical accounting rules to manage the kingdom's finances, while another conjures up real-time visualizations of flying dragons. üêâ

To understand these modules, one has to learn the castle's language. A module can contain various elements like business objects, object views, data files, web controllers, and even static web data like images and scripts. Each element serves a unique purpose, contributing to the castle's grandeur. üåü

Imagine a brave adventurer embarking on a journey to create their own module. They venture into the module's directory, organized neatly like rooms in a castle. Inside, they find business objects, declared as Python classes, object views defining how information is displayed, and data files, either XML or CSV, holding vital information for the castle's operation. üõ†Ô∏è

But wait, there are different versions of this castle! Odoo comes in two flavors: Enterprise and Community. The Enterprise version, with its licensed access, offers extra features, like secret chambers hidden within the castle walls. However, from a technical standpoint, these extra features are just additional modules layered atop the Community version. üîí

Now, our adventurer is ready to embark on their journey. But before diving into writing code, they decide to prepare by reviewing the castle's installation process. After all, even seasoned knights need to ensure they start their quests on the right foot. üöÄ

And thus, armed with knowledge and determination, our adventurer sets forth to conquer the realm of Odoo, one module at a time. üåå

## [SETUP GUIDE] Development Environment Configuration


### Note:
> `./addons` : This directory contains all the modules we want to add to Odoo 17. Therefore, it includes the module we are going to develop.

> This directory will be part of the addon paths that reference all directories containing Odoo modules.
> 
> 
> `./config/odoo.conf` : This file contains Odoo configurations.
>
> `docker-compose.yml` : This file contains deployment configurations for deploying Odoo on localhost.

üåê In the world of Odoo, where developers shape the digital corridors of the software, setting up the development environment is a key step. Like a chef preparing their favorite recipe, each developer has their own method, but for Odoo insiders, there's a preferred path: installation from the source code.

It all starts with environment preparation. Just like preparing ingredients to concoct a delightful dish, following the steps of the contribution guide is essential. Once these steps are followed, you have two precious ingredients: the local repositories [odoo/odoo](https://github.com/odoo/odoo) and [odoo/enterprise](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise).

For easier installation, it's better to use the [containerized version of Odoo](https://hub.docker.com/_/odoo/) and then orchestrate with Docker. Take a look at the `./docker-compose.yml` file.

To complete the preparation, you need to copy this project to your personal GitHub account. Click `"Fork"` to create a copy of this repository in your account.

Then, using the command below, replace `<your_github_account>` with the name of your GitHub account to download your copy of this project to your machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<votre_compte_github>/learning-odoo-17.git
```

And there you go! Your environment is ready to run Odoo on your local machine. And here's how to launch Odoo 17 on your machine:

```bash
cd learning-odoo-17
docker compose up -d
```
To check the installation, simply open your browser and type [http://localhost:8069/web](http://localhost:8069/web).

```yaml
username : admin
password : admin
```

![Odoo Login Page Capture](docs/images/odoo-login.png)

To view the `logs` data of the `odoo` container:

```bash
docker logs -f odoo17Learning
docker logs -f postgres_odoo17Learning
```

![Odoo Logs Capture](docs/images/odoo-logs.png)

To view the `logs` data the `postgres` container:

```bash
docker logs -f postgres_odoo17Learning
```
![Postgress Logs Capture](docs/images/postgres-logs.png)

Now that your server is running, it's time to write our own application! üòé

## Chapter 2 : A New Application.

üìñ The purpose of this chapter is to embark on a journey of creation, laying the very foundation for a brand new `Odoo module`. Imagine starting from scratch, with only the bare essentials needed to catch Odoo's attention. As we progress through the chapters, we'll add layers of features, weaving a tapestry of a realistic business case.

üè† Welcome to the realm of the `Real Estate` Advertisement module. This module delves into a specialized business area not commonly found in the standard set of Odoo modules: `real estate`. But before diving headfirst into development, it's wise to scout Odoo's vast kingdom to ensure no existing solutions already address our specific needs.

üîç Picture a main `list view` adorned with various advertisements, each telling a story of properties waiting to be discovered. The form view reveals essential details about each property: from the number of bedrooms to the presence of a garden, offering a glimpse into the world within.

![App Overview Capture](docs/images/app-overview.png)

üíº The second tab unveils a treasure trove of `offers`, where potential `buyers` can make `bids` above or below the expected `selling price`. It's a realm where `negotiations` unfold, leaving the final decision in the hands of the `seller`.

![App Overview Offers Capture](docs/images/app-overview-offers.png)

üé• And as if by magic, a quick video showcases the graceful dance of the module's workflow. Ah, if only it were captured already!

üõ† But fret not, for our journey begins with a humble task: preparing the `addon directory`. This step ensures that Odoo recognizes our newborn module, even if it's but an empty vessel for now. Soon, it will proudly stand among the `Apps`, awaiting its chance to shine.

‚ú® With a flick of a wand (or perhaps a few keyboard strokes), we create the necessary files: `__init__.py` and `__manifest__.py`. These files breathe life into our module, defining its `name` and `dependencies`, much like a spellbook detailing the ingredients of a potent potion.

üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `Restart` the Odoo server, `update` the Apps list, and behold! Our module, like a budding flower, blooms into view. But wait, did it not appear? Fear not, for a simple tweak, removing the `default filter`, reveals our creation in all its glory.

![App Real Estate Capture](docs/images/app-real.png)

üîë And now, with a final flourish, `we make our module an 'App'`, ensuring its presence even when the `Apps filter` is on. Though it may be but an empty shell, devoid of menus, it's a promising start to our magical journey.

üìú With the groundwork laid, our adventure continues as we prepare to `create our first model`. Exciting times lie ahead as we breathe life into our module, one enchanting step at a time.

---

## Chapter 3 : Models And Basic Fields

üè∞ Picture our `Odoo module` as a freshly built house - sturdy and promising, yet lacking the warmth of life within its walls. In this chapter, our quest was to breathe life into our module by giving it the ability to `store data`. üíº

As we delved deeper into the documentation, we discovered [Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/types/relational/what-is-an-orm), a wondrous tool bridging the gap between our Python code and the `database`. ‚ú® This powerful technique allows us to define our `business objects as Python classes`, extending the `Model` class. With a simple invocation, our model came to life, seamlessly integrating into Odoo's automated persistence system.

Our task was to create the `real estate properties model`. Inspired by the example given in the `CRM module`, we embarked on our quest, shaping the necessary files and folders to define our `model`. üè° With each keystroke, the framework began to take shape, and soon, our model stood proudly, ready to capture the essence of `real estate properties`.

But our journey did not end there. We set out to infuse our model with `basic fields`, such as `name`, `description`, and `price`. Like an artisan adding details to a work of art, we enriched our model with `fields` of different `types` - `Char`, `Text`, `Integer`, and even `Boolean`. Each field brought a new dimension to our `model`, enriching it with the essence of real-world data. üé®

üí° Here's how to connect to the database inside the container to view the data.

```bash
docker exec -it postgres_odoo17Learning psql -U admin -d learning_db

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM estate_property;

\d estate_property;
```

![Postgres EstateProperty Model Capture](docs/images/app-postgres-estate-property.png)

Yet, our work was not complete until we ensured the `integrity` of our `data`. With a flourish of our craftsmanship, we defined `attributes` for our `fields`, making them `required` and ensuring their presence in every `record`. We even explored the realm of `Automatic Fields`, uncovering the hidden mechanism behind fields like `id`, `create_date`, and `write_user`. üîÆ

And so, our journey through Chapter 4 came to an end, but our module was now imbued with the power to `store and manage` real estate `data`. With each step forward, our `module` grew stronger, paving the way for greater adventures in the realm of `Odoo`. üöÄ

---

## Chapter 4: Security - A Brief Introduction

In the journey of building our `Odoo module`, we've ventured into the realm of `security`, a crucial aspect in any software application, especially when it comes to managing `sensitive` business `data`. üè∞

Imagine our `module` as a fortified castle, safeguarding valuable `information` about properties and transactions within its walls. But who gets `access` to enter this castle? This is where `Odoo's security mechanism` comes into play, like the gatekeeper controlling entry to the castle. üõ°Ô∏è

We've learned that `Odoo` relies heavily on data, and one way to populate our `module` with essential information is through `CSV files`. These files act as the blueprint, defining the structure and content of our data. For instance, we've seen how a `CSV file` sets up the states of countries, laying the foundation for our data castle. üìã

However, `loading data` is just one part of the `security` equation. We also need to `control` who can `view`, `edit`, `create`, or `delete` this data. This is where `access rights` come in. Access rights act as the guards patrolling the castle walls, ensuring only `authorized users` can access specific areas. üö®

To implement `access rights`, we create `rules` that dictate what each `user` or `group` of users can do within our `module`. These `rules` are defined in `CSV files`, just like our data files, and are loaded into Odoo's security system.

In our journey, we've set out to `grant access rights` to the `base.group_user`, essentially allowing them to roam freely within our module, albeit within certain limits. üîí

![Postgres EstateProperty Model Capture](docs/images/app-security.png)

With `access rights` in place, our module's `security` is fortified, and we're now ready to open the gates and let users interact with our `module's user interface`, marking the next phase of our adventure in Odoo development. üöÄ

---

## Chapter 5: Finally, Some UI To Play With

Now that we've laid the foundation with our new `model` and access rights, it's time to dive into the exciting world of `user interface` interaction. üöÄ

### Data Files (XML)

In our journey to understand `Odoo`, we've encountered various ways to handle `data`. While `CSV files` are great for simple data, the `XML format` steps in for more `complex structures` like `views` or email templates. These `XML files`, residing in the same folders as `CSVs`, define the intricate `UI elements` we interact with. üìù

![Data Files XML Capture](docs/images/app-view-action.png)

### Actions and Menus

`Actions` are the `bridge` between `menus` and `models`, defining what happens when we `click` or interact with `elements` in the interface. In our `real estate` scenario, actions empower us to navigate through lists and `forms` seamlessly. ‚öôÔ∏è

![Action and Menu Capture](docs/images/app-real-estate.png)

`Menus` in Odoo follow a `hierarchical structure`, guiding us through different `levels` of the `interface`. By defining `menus` in `XML files`, we craft an intuitive `navigation` experience for users, leading them to the heart of our application. üìÇ

### Fields, Attributes, and Views

Fine-tuning the `view` is crucial for a `user-friendly` experience. We can set `default values` for fields, specify `read-only` fields, and control field behavior during `duplication`. In our `real estate` adventure, we ensure that our data behaves as expected, setting defaults and enforcing `rules` for smoother operations. üé®

![GoHome Property Capture](docs/images/app-estate-gohome.png)

### Reserved Fields and States

Certain `fields` in Odoo come with `predefined behaviors`, guiding how data behaves within the system. By understanding and leveraging these `reserved fields`, we can fine-tune our application to suit our needs effectively. üõ†Ô∏è

With each step, we're unlocking new possibilities in our journey with `Odoo`. As we delve deeper into defining our `views`, the interface becomes not just a canvas but a portal to a seamless `user experience`. üåü

---

## Chapter 6: Basic Views

üåü In our journey through Odoo's realm, we've ventured into crafting `models` and setting up `access rights`. Now, it's time to give our application a face, a `user interface` where users can interact and bring our creation to life.

`Views`, the windows to our application's soul, are where the magic happens. They `organize and present data` in a way that's not only meaningful but also intuitive for users to `navigate`.

Imagine you're building a `real estate` app. You wouldn't want just a `list` of properties or a cluttered `form`. You'd want an `organized layout` where users can easily find what they need. That's where `views` come in.

### List Views: üìã
![Property Custom List View Capture](docs/images/app-list-view.png)

Think of `list views` as the bird's-eye view of your data. They're like `spreadsheets`, neatly arranging `records` for easy scanning. In our `real estate app`, we want more than just property names on this list. We want to see `essential details` like the last seen date too.

### Form Views: üìù

![Property Custom Form View Capture](docs/images/app-estate-formview.png)

Now, imagine you're `editing` a property's `details`. You wouldn't want a chaotic mess of fields. `Form views` provide structure. They `group fields` logically, making it easy to `input` or `edit` property `information`. It's like filling out a `form` where everything has its place.

### Search Views: üîç

`Searching` for a property? `Search views` help narrow down your options. They `filter` out unwanted clutter, leaving you with exactly `what you need`. In our app, we want to `filter` properties by `availability` and `group` them by `postcode` for convenience.

![Property Custom Filters Capture](docs/images/app-filters.png)

As we sculpt these `views`, remember, it's not just about aesthetics. It's about `creating an experience` that users will `love`. So, let's dive in and `design views` that breathe life into our real estate world.

### Note:

We're just scratching the surface here. There's still much to explore, like `custom filters` and `grouping`. But for now, let's revel in the joy of creating `views` that make our `app shine`.

---

## Chapter 7: Relations Between Models

In our quest to build the ultimate `real estate management system`, we've journeyed through the intricacies of crafting `models` and designing intuitive `views`. Now, armed with a deeper understanding of how `views` shape user `interaction`, we venture into the realm of `model relationships`.

Imagine our `real estate application` as a bustling marketplace, where properties, customers, and agents converge in a complex web of `connections`. Just as our `views` provide windows into our `data`, these `relationships` offer pathways for seamless `interactions` between different `entities`.

### Many2one: üåê

In our bustling real estate marketplace, `properties` often have distinct `types`, `buyers`, and `sellers`. With `Many2one` fields, we establish clear links between these entities, enabling us to easily associate each property with its type, buyer, and seller. 

![Property Types Capture](docs/images/app-types.png)

![Types into Property Capture](docs/images/app-types-property.png)


It's like building bridges that `connect` different parts of our marketplace, ensuring smooth navigation for users.


### Many2many: üîó

But our marketplace isn't just about individual properties; it's about the stories they tell. With `Many2many relationships`, we enrich these stories by tagging properties with descriptive labels like 'cozy' or 'renovated.' 

![Property Tags Capture](docs/images/app-tags.png)

![Tags into Property Capture](docs/images/app-types-property.png)


It's like adding layers of depth to our marketplace, allowing users to explore properties based on unique characteristics.

### One2many: üîÑ

And what's a marketplace without `offers`? With `One2many relationships`, we capture the dynamic exchange of offers between buyers and sellers. Each property can now boast a gallery of offers, each representing a potential transaction waiting to unfold. 

![Offers into Property Capture](docs/images/app-offer.png)

It's like opening a window into the negotiation process, where every offer adds to the intrigue of our marketplace.

As we weave these `relationships` into the fabric of our `real estate module`, we create a dynamic ecosystem where data flows seamlessly between entities. It's not just about organizing information; it's about fostering meaningful connections that bring our marketplace to life.

And so, armed with the knowledge of `model relationships`, we embark on the next phase of our journey, eager to explore the boundless possibilities that await us in the realm of `Odoo`.

*Notes:*
> Because a `One2many` is a `virtual` relationship, there must be a `Many2one` field defined in the `comodel`.


---

## Chapter 8: Computed Fields And Onchanges

In our journey to master the intricacies of Odoo 17, we find ourselves standing at the threshold of a new frontier: `computed fields` and `onchange` mechanisms. These may sound daunting, but fear not, for they hold the key to unlocking the true potential of our `real estate` management system.

### Unveiling Computed Fields: üßÆ

Imagine our `real estate` system as a grand canvas, waiting to be painted with `data`. `Computed fields` are our brushes, allowing us to `dynamically` calculate values based on other `fields`. It's like magic; we define the rules, and Odoo does the rest.

For instance, let's say we want to `calculate` the `total area` of a property by summing up its `living area` and `garden area`. With `computed fields`, this becomes a breeze. We simply define the formula, and Odoo handles the calculations behind the scenes.

### Embracing Dependencies: üîó

But here's the catch: `computed fields` often rely on the values of other fields. Think of them as puzzle pieces that fit together to form a complete picture. We use the `@api.depends` decorator to specify these `dependencies`, ensuring that our computations stay in `sync` with the underlying `data`.

![Computed fields fields Capture](docs/images/chap9-onchange.png)

For example, if the living area or garden area of a property `changes`, we want the total area to `update automatically`. By defining these `dependencies`, Odoo knows exactly when to recalculate the total area, keeping our `data` accurate and `up-to-date`.

### Mastering Onchange Magic: üé©

Now, let's shift our focus to `onchange` mechanisms, the wizards of `data manipulation`. Imagine our `real estate` system as a living, breathing entity that `responds` to user inputs in `real-time`. `Onchange methods` allow us to perform actions on the fly, without ever saving anything to the database.

Suppose we want to enhance the user experience by `automatically` setting the garden area to 10 and the orientation to North when the 'garden' field is toggled on. `Onchange methods` make this possible, creating a seamless and intuitive interface for our users.

![Onchange fields Capture](docs/images/chap9-onchange.png)


### Striking a Balance: ‚öñÔ∏è

As we delve deeper into the realm of `computed fields` and `onchanges`, it's crucial to strike a balance. While these tools empower us to `automate tasks` and streamline workflows, we must exercise caution not to overcomplicate things.

Remember, `simplicity` is key. Avoid the temptation to add unnecessary complexity, and always prioritize `clarity` and ease of use. After all, our goal is to build a `real estate` management system that empowers users of all levels, from novice to expert.

### Looking Ahead: üîç

Armed with the knowledge of `computed fields` and `onchanges`, we stand poised to embark on the next leg of our journey. In the upcoming chapter, we'll explore how to trigger business logic with the click of a `button`, unlocking even greater possibilities for our `real estate` management system.

So, dear traveler, let us march forward with confidence, for the path ahead is paved with boundless opportunities to shape the future of `real estate` management with Odoo 17.

---

## Chapter 9: Ready For Some Action?

As we continue our odyssey through the realms of Odoo 17, we find ourselves at a pivotal juncture, where the concepts of `computed fields` and `onchange` mechanisms have laid the foundation for even greater feats within our `real estate` management system.

### Harnessing the Power of Action: üöÄ

Picture our `real estate` system as a bustling marketplace, alive with possibilities. Now, imagine imbuing it with the ability to take `action‚Äîcanceling` properties, marking them as `sold`, accepting or refusing offers‚Äîall with the click of a button. This is the realm of `action buttons`, where digital switches trigger tasks that shape the destiny of our system.

### Seamlessly Integrated Functionality: üîß

But how do we make this magic happen? It's simple yet profound. We embed `buttons` in our interface, each tied to a specific action. 

![Action buttons Capture](docs/images/chap10-action.png)

When users click these `buttons`, they set off a chain reaction of events, seamlessly integrating functionality into our system's fabric.

### A Symphony of Logic and User Experience: üé∂

These `action buttons` serve as conduits for our system's logic, orchestrating a symphony of user experience and functionality. 

Want to `cancel` a property? Just hit `"Cancel."` Sold it? Press `"Sold."` The process is intuitive, guided by the logic we've meticulously woven into our system.

![Action buttons Cancel and Sold Capture](docs/images/chap10-action-cancel-sold.png)


But that's not all. We want our system to handle offers with grace and efficiency. By adding buttons like `"Accept"` and `"Refuse"` to our offer listings, we can streamline the process even further. And when an offer is `accepted`, the magic happens: the buyer is assigned, the selling price is set, all seamlessly orchestrated by the click of a button.

![Action buttons Cancel and Sold Capture](docs/images/chap10-action-accept-refused.png)

Now, you might wonder, how do we bring this magic to life? It's simpler than you think. We embed these `buttons` into our interface and `link` them `to` Python `methods` that perform the `desired actions`. By marking these `methods as public` and assigning them to the `buttons`, we unleash their power upon our system.

### Guiding Principles: üåü

Yet, as we venture deeper into the realm of `action buttons`, let us heed a few guiding principles. `Simplicity` reigns supreme; let's resist the allure of unnecessary complexity. `Clarity` and `ease of use` should guide our every decision, ensuring that our system empowers users of all levels.

### A Glimpse of Tomorrow: üîÆ

With `action buttons` at our disposal, we stand on the cusp of a new dawn. In the chapters to come, we'll explore how to `prevent incorrect data` from infiltrating our system, fortifying its foundations and ensuring its resilience in the face of real-world challenges.

So, fellow voyager, let us embark on this journey with heads held high, for the path ahead brims with promise and the potential to reshape the landscape of `real estate` management with Odoo 17.

**Notes:**

> In **Chapter 6: Finally, Some UI To Play With**, we created an action that was linked to a menu. You may be wondering if it `is possible to link an action to a button`. Good news, it is! One way to do it is:
> ```xml
> <button type="action" name="your_module.action_name" string="Button Label"/>
> ```

---

## Chapter 10: Constraints

With the dawn of Chapter 9, we embraced the power of `action buttons`, transforming our real estate management system into a dynamic marketplace of possibilities. Yet, as our journey unfolded, we encountered a new challenge: ensuring the integrity of our data amidst the ever-changing currents of user input.

### Safeguarding the Realm: ‚öîÔ∏è

In our quest for data integrity, we discovered the formidable tools of `constraints`. These guardians of `truth` stood as sentinels, warding off the specter of incorrect `data` with unwavering resolve.

### The Arsenal of Constraints: üõ°Ô∏è

With Chapter 11, we delved deeper into the arsenal of constraints, uncovering two mighty weapons: `SQL constraints` and `Python constraints`. Like knights donning armor, SQL constraints fortified our database with impenetrable barriers, ensuring that amounts remained positive and names stood as unique beacons of identity.

### The Wisdom of Odoo: üìú

Yet, in the labyrinth of data management, `SQL` alone could not suffice. With `Python` constraints, we wielded the wisdom of Odoo to craft intricate spells of logic, guarding against the subtle nuances of incorrect data with precision and finesse.

### An Exercise in Mastery: üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Guided by the hand of Odoo, we embarked on exercises that tested our skills and honed our craft. From ensuring positive prices to safeguarding the uniqueness of property tags, each challenge brought us closer to mastery over our realm of data.

![SQL Constraints Capture](docs/images/chap11-sql-constraints.png)

In our quest to perfect our real estate module, we encountered an exercise of great importance: to ensure that **no offer could be accepted if it dared to fall below 90%** of the expected price. With the guidance of Odoo, we crafted a `Python constraint`, leveraging the power of float comparison to safeguard our realm against unwelcome intruders.

![SQL Constraints Capture](docs/images/chap11-python-constraints.png)

### A Cautionary Tale: ‚ö†Ô∏è

But amidst our triumphs, a cautionary tale echoed through the halls of our adventure. Odoo warned us to tread carefully when working with floats, urging us to wield the tools of float comparison and precision handling with care and reverence.

### A Journey Unfolds: üåü

As our tale draws to a close, we stand on the threshold of a new chapter, where the user interface awaits our touch of refinement. With each constraint we add, with every line of code we write, our real estate management system evolves, poised to shape the future of property management with Odoo 17.

---

## Chapter 11: Add The Sprinkles

With the formidable arsenal of constraints now firmly in place, our real estate management system stands as a fortress of `data integrity`, safeguarded against the specter of erroneous input. 

Yet, as our journey through `Odoo 17` continues, we find ourselves at a pivotal juncture: the refinement of our user interface.

In the previous Chapter, we fortified our realm with the formidable tools of SQL and `Python constraints`, ensuring that our data remained pristine amidst the tumultuous currents of user interaction. 

Now, as we gaze upon the landscape of our real estate `module`, we recognize the need to add a touch of `visual flair` and `intuitive functionality` to enhance the user experience.

As we embark upon this Chapter, our mission is clear: to add the final touches that will elevate our real estate `management` system from a mere tool to a delightful and `intuitive` platform for property management.

### Adding Visual Flair:
- We aspire to infuse our `list views` with vibrant `colors`, distinguishing properties with offers received, offers accepted, and those that have been sold or canceled.

![Decorations Capture](docs/images/chap12-visual-flair.png)

- Through the judicious use of color `decorations`, we aim to create a visual language that intuitively conveys the status of each property at a glance.

### Streamlining User Interactions:
- We seek to streamline user `interactions` by dynamically adjusting the `visibility` of buttons and fields based on contextual conditions.

![Visible Buttons Capture](docs/images/chap12-visible-buttons.png)

![Invisible Buttons Capture](docs/images/chap12-invisible-buttons.png)


- By employing conditional `visibility attributes`, we can ensure that users are presented with only the most relevant `options` at any given moment, enhancing usability and reducing cognitive load.

### Empowering Efficient Searching:
- We endeavor to empower users with `efficient search` capabilities, enabling them to quickly `filter` properties with `values` based on `specific criteria` such as living area.

![Filter with value Capture](docs/images/chap12-filter-value.png)

- Through the addition of default filters and custom search domains, we aim to streamline the search process, facilitating faster access to relevant property listings.

![Default Filter Capture](docs/images/chap12-default-filter.png)

### Elevating Data Presentation:
- We aspire to elevate the presentation of data within our `forms` and lists, leveraging `inline views` to provide contextual insights and enabling users to interact with related `records` seamlessly.

![Default Filter Capture](docs/images/chap12-inline-view.png)


- By harnessing the power of `widgets`, we can tailor the display of fields to suit the unique requirements of our real estate module, enhancing `clarity` and usability.

### Unveiling Insights with Stat Buttons:
- We recognize the value of providing users with quick access to insightful data, and thus, we seek to implement `stat buttons` that offer a glimpse into key metrics such as the number of offers associated with a specific property type.

- Through the judicious use of `related fields` and custom actions, we aim to unveil actionable insights with a single click, empowering users to make informed decisions.

As we embark upon this journey to add the final sprinkles to our `real estate module`, we do so with a sense of purpose and determination. With each enhancement we introduce, we draw closer to our vision of creating a user experience that is both delightful and `intuitive`, setting the stage for a new era in property management with Odoo 17.

## Chapter 12: Inheritance üè∞

After adding the final üé® decorative touches to our üè† `real estate module` in the previous chapter, we now dive into this chapter to explore even more features that enhance the user experience.

### Inheriting for Innovation:
Like meticulous craftsmen, we seek to refine existing functionalities by exploring üîó `inheritance` mechanisms in Odoo. This allows us to ‚ûï `add new features` while preserving code integrity and system stability.

### Python Inheritance:
Similar to superheroes acquiring new powers, we learn to üöÄ `extend standard methods` of data creation, reading, writing, and deletion.

![Deletion Prevention Capture](docs/images/chap13-prevent-deletion.png)

For example, we now üö´ prevent the `accidental deletion` of important properties by disallowing the deletion of any property that is not new or canceled.

### Model Inheritance:
Like an artist üé® painting a canvas, we ‚ûï `add new fields` to our existing models to enrich the functionality of our system.

### View Inheritance:
As user experience architects, we üõ†Ô∏è `customize` the appearance of our `user interface` by inheriting existing `views` and adapting them to our specific needs.

![Model Inheritance Capture](docs/images/chap13-inheritance-view.png)

For example, we ‚ûï `add a new tab` in the user view to display a list of `available properties`, providing users with quick and intuitive access to relevant information.

üòÉ With each new improvement we make, we move closer to our goal of creating an exceptional and intuitive user experience.

By `fine-tuning` details, `adding` new features, and `refining` the user interface, we shape Odoo to perfectly meet the needs of our business, paving the way for even more efficient and effective `real estate` management with Odoo 17. üåü

## Chapter 13: Interact With Other Modules ü§ù

Building upon the foundation laid in previous Chapter, where we delved into the art of inheritance to enhance our `real estate module`, we now embark on a new journey of `integration` and collaboration.

### Bridging the Gap with Invoicing

As we continue to polish our `real estate` solution, we recognize the need to seamlessly `connect` with other `modules`, unlocking new functionalities and streamlining workflows. In this chapter, our focus shifts towards `integrating` with the `Invoicing module` to automate the `invoice generation` process. üìëüíº

### Introducing the Link Module

Just as skilled artisans carefully craft intricate designs, we meticulously design a `'link' module` to bridge our `real estate` and `accounting` functionalities. 

![Link Module Capture](docs/images/chap14-link-module.png)

By depending on both the `estate` and `account` modules, this `link module` serves as a conduit for data exchange, ensuring interoperability while maintaining `modularity`. üåêüîó

### Model Inheritance: Extending Capabilities

In the spirit of innovation, we extend our `real estate` module's capabilities through `model inheritance`. 

By `overriding` the `action triggered` when a property is `sold`, we lay the groundwork for `automated invoice` creation, seamlessly integrating with the Invoicing module. üöÄüè†

### Crafting Invoices with Precision

With the framework in place, we turn our attention to crafting `invoices` with precision. 

![Empty Invoice Capture](docs/images/chap14-empty-invoice.png)

Each `invoice` is meticulously populated with essential details such as customer ID and move type, setting the stage for accurate financial transactions. üßæüí≥

### Adding Finishing Touches: Invoice Lines

Just as a skilled artist adds brushstrokes to complete a masterpiece, we add `invoice lines` to our invoices. 

![Invoice Lines Capture](docs/images/chap14-invoice-line.png)



Each line meticulously `captures transaction` specifics, ensuring clarity and accuracy in financial records. üé®‚ú®

![Invoice List Capture](docs/images/chap14-invoice-list.png)


### A Seamless Integration Journey

With each step, our `real estate` solution evolves into a comprehensive and integrated platform. By seamlessly connecting with the `Invoicing module`, we empower users with automated workflows and enhanced efficiency.

As we navigate through this integration journey, we draw closer to our vision of creating a seamless and intuitive real estate management solution with Odoo 17. üè°üîß

## Chapter 14: A Brief History Of QWeb

Building upon the harmonious collaboration achieved in previous chapter, where our `real estate module` intertwined with the `Invoicing module`, we now embark on a quest to infuse our interface with unparalleled charm and flexibility. üåü

In this chapter, we journey into the mystical realm of `QWeb Templates`, a realm where design and functionality converge in harmony. As we gaze upon the landscape of our `real estate application`, we realize that to truly captivate our users, we must transcend the ordinary and embrace the extraordinary. üèûÔ∏è

`QWeb Templates` emerge as our guiding light, offering us the power to weave intricate `designs` and `dynamic templates` with ease. With `QWeb` as our ally, we set out to create a wondrous `Kanban view` for our properties. üé®

In the enchanted land of Odoo, a `Kanban view` is no mere display of data; it `is a canvas` upon which we paint our dreams and aspirations. With each stroke of our virtual brush, we bring life to the cards, infusing them with meaning and purpose. üñåÔ∏è


![Kanban Basic View Capture](docs/images/chap15-basic-kanban-view.png)


As we delve deeper into the mysteries of `QWeb`, we discover the art of `conditional display`, allowing our properties to reveal their secrets only when the time is right. Through the `t-if` directive, we wield the power to create dynamic and engaging interfaces that respond to the whims of our users. üé≠

But our journey does not end there. With the knowledge gained from our adventures in QWeb, we embark on a quest to improve our `Kanban view` further. We adorn it with treasures such as expected price, best price, selling price, and tags, transforming each card into a masterpiece of information and insight. üíº

![Kanban Group Capture](docs/images/chap15-kanban-group.png)

And as the final touch to our masterpiece, we invoke the ancient magic of `default grouping`, arranging our properties by type with effortless grace. With a wave of our wand, we create harmony amidst chaos, ensuring that each card finds its rightful place in the grand tapestry of our `real estate` application. üåå

As our journey through the realm of `QWeb` comes to a close, we emerge as masters of `interface design`, armed with the knowledge and skills to create captivating and immersive experiences for our users. With `QWeb` as our guide, we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, forging new paths and unlocking new horizons in the world of `Odoo development`. üöÄ

## Chapter 15: The final word

As our journey through the realm of `Odoo` nears its conclusion, we stand on the precipice of greatness, poised to embark on one final quest: the `pursuit of perfection` in our code. üè∞

Guided by the ancient principles of the [Odoo coding guidelines](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/17.0/contributing/development/coding_guidelines.html), we set forth to refine our creations and elevate them to new heights of excellence. These `guidelines`, like the sacred scriptures of our craft, are a roadmap to `improving the quality` of our `Odoo Apps code`. üìú‚ú®

With each line of code we `refactor`, we breathe life into our creations, imbuing them with the essence of best practices and standards. We meticulously adhere to the `module structure`, ensuring that our `code is organized` and easy to navigate. We choose `variable names` with care, selecting words that convey meaning and `clarity`. Our method names follow a convention that speaks to the heart of `readability` and `coherence`. üíªüîç

As we `polish our code` to a brilliant sheen, we heed the call to run our `linter`, the vigilant guardian of `code quality`. With its watchful eye, we detect and rectify any deviations from the `guidelines`, ensuring that our code stands as a paragon of excellence. üõ°Ô∏èüîß

But our journey does not end there. With our code refined and perfected, we turn our gaze towards the horizon and behold the majestic [runbot](https://runbot.odoo.com/), `Odoo's` own `guardian` of stability and reliability. Here, on this sacred ground, every commit, branch, and pull request undergoes `rigorous testing` to prevent `regressions` and uphold the sanctity of the `stable versions`. ü§ñ‚öôÔ∏è

### Coding guidelines

Once upon a time in the kingdom of Odoo, there were sacred rules known as the `Coding Guidelines`. These guidelines were like magic spells that aimed to make the code of Odoo Apps shine brighter than the stars. üåü

You see, `proper code` was more than just lines on a screen; it was the key to unlocking the secrets of `readability`, the sword that vanquished `complexity`, and the shield that guarded against `bugs`. And so, every developer who dared to venture into the realm of Odoo was expected to abide by these `guidelines`, for they held the secrets to crafting `software` of the highest `quality`.

But heed this warning, dear reader: when treading upon the paths of `stable versions`, thou shalt not tamper with existing files! For the style of those files is sacred, and any attempt to alter them would disrupt the very fabric of `revision history`. Keep thy changes minimal, and let the `original style` reign supreme.


#### Module structure

And in the land of `directories`, where modules took shape, there lay the heart of business logic. From `data` to `models`, `controllers` to `views`, each directory whispered its purpose to those who dared to listen. 

And `file naming`? Ah, a tale as old as time itself! For in Odoo, the names of files were like breadcrumbs leading developers on a journey of `understanding`. Whether it be models or security, views or wizards, each file bore a name that revealed its `true essence`.

But let us not forget the stories of `controllers` and static files, where `JavaScript` and templates danced in harmony, each with its own place in the grand tapestry of code. And `wizards`, with their `transient models` and views, added a touch of magic to the world of Odoo.


So, dear reader, as you embark on your quest through the documentation of Odoo 17, remember these tales of the `Coding Guidelines`. For they are not mere rules to be followed, but the very essence of craftsmanship in the enchanted kingdom of code. üè∞‚ú®‚ú®

#### XML files

Once upon a time in the bustling kitchen of Odoo, there existed a language known as `XML`, akin to the recipes that held the very essence of culinary creations.

In this lively kitchen, `XML files` were like well-worn cookbooks, each containing the recipe for a delightful dish of Odoo. But fear not, for even the novice chef could decipher their secrets with the help of the `XML Format`.

Behold, the `<record>` notation, a powerful recipe that brought forth new flavors into the kitchen of Odoo. With it, one could declare `views`, `actions`, and even `menus` with ease. But remember, young chef, to season with the `id` attribute before the `model`, for it is the key to unlocking the flavor within.

And what of ingredients, you ask? Ah, their declaration was a dance of syntax, where the `name` attribute led the way, followed by the `value` in the `field` tag or `eval` attribute. And let us not forget the other attributes, `ordered by importance`, for they too played a role in shaping the taste of Odoo.

But wait! There are shortcuts, dear chef, shortcuts that can save you from the labyrinth of `XML`. The `menuitem` and `template` tags, acting as sous-chefs in the kitchen, allow you to declare `menus` and `QWeb views` with but a few ingredients.

Now, onto `XML IDs` and `naming`, a topic as vast as the pantry itself. For `menus`, `views`, and `actions`, there exists a recipe, a recipe that ensures `clarity` and `understanding` in the kitchen of Odoo. And let us not forget `security`, where `groups` and `rules` are named with care, each bearing the mark of its culinary purpose.

But what of `inheritance`, you ask? Fear not, for even in the world of `XML`, there exists a path for the brave. `Inheriting XML` is a tale of flavors and combinations, where `IDs` remain the same, yet hold the power of transformation within.

So, young chef, as you journey through the kitchen of Odoo, remember these tales of `XML`. For they are the recipes to unlocking the flavors that lie within, guiding you on your quest to become a master of the culinary arts. üç≥üë®‚Äçüç≥

#### Python

Once upon a time in the vibrant world of Odoo, there existed a magical language known as `Python` üêç, where developers wielded the power of code to bring their digital creations to life.

But heed this warning, dear coder, for the path of Python is fraught with peril! Do not venture forth without first acquainting yourself with the `Security Pitfalls` section üö®, for it holds the secrets to writing code that guards against nefarious forces.

Now, imagine a realm where code is not just lines on a screen, but a symphony of structure and `style`. Enter the world of `PEP8` options, where a `linter` acts as a vigilant guardian, ensuring that your code adheres to the `standards` of the Python elders üìè. Though some rules may seem arbitrary, they serve to maintain order and `clarity` in the land of code.

Behold, the `Imports`, an organized procession of `external` libraries, `Odoo` essentials, and `module` treasures üìö. Like ingredients in a grand feast üç≤, they are arranged with care, each serving a specific purpose in the grand recipe of your code.

But what of the `Idiomatics of Programming`, you ask? Ah, here lies the heart of `Pythonic wisdom`! From the humble creation of `dictionaries` to the art of `list comprehensions`, these are the guiding principles that transform mere code into `elegant expressions` of logic and clarity ‚ú®.

And let us not forget the `Symbols` and `Conventions`, where even the naming of variables and methods follows a sacred tradition üèõÔ∏è. From `camelcase` in Python classes to the meticulous `ordering` of attributes and methods within a model, every detail serves to honor the craftsmanship of coding.

But beware, young developer, for the road ahead is fraught with challenges. Do not be tempted by the allure of `manual commits` or the misuse of translation methods, for they may lead you down a treacherous path of `broken code` and `lost data`.

In the realm of Odoo, where the digital pursue the perfection, remember these tales of Python. For they are the keys to unlocking the `full potential` of your code, `guiding` you on your quest to become a master of the craft üõ†Ô∏è.

#### JavaScript


Once upon a time, in the bustling kitchen of Odoo, where digital recipes were concocted, there existed a special ingredient known as `Javascript`. But much like any culinary craft, it had its own recipe book and kitchen `rules`, guiding the chefs as they whipped up their digital delicacies üç≥.

In this savory realm of `web development`, where ingredients danced on the digital stove, the organization of `static files` was akin to the meticulous arrangement of ingredients on a chef's cutting board ü•ï. Within the pantry of the `static folder`, each file had its designated shelf, carefully arranged according to the culinary `conventions` of the Odoo chefs.

Enter the pantry's `library` section, a treasure trove of culinary knowledge where the whispers of seasoned recipes like `jQuery` and others could be heard. Here, within its hallowed shelves, chefs sought the wisdom of the culinary elders to enrich their creations.

But the journey didn't end there, for beyond the `libraries` lay the heart of the kitchen - the ingredients cupboard üå∂Ô∏è. Within its shelves dwelled the source ingredients, divided into sacred sections of spices, herbs, oils, and more.

And so, the chefs were reminded to embrace the culinary `traditions` of strict measurements and the `guidance` of kitchen tools üßä. For in the world of `Javascript`, adherence to the culinary `rules` was paramount, ensuring that the recipe remained pure and free from error.

But heed this warning, dear chefs: never succumb to the temptation of `prepackaged` ingredients, for they are but shadows of their fresh counterparts, lacking the flavor that once made them great.

Armed with the knowledge of `Javascript` culinary `guidelines`, the chefs ventured forth into the digital kitchen, their code a flavorful dish in the banquet of the `web`. For in the kitchen of Odoo, where digital recipes are cooked to perfection, it is the code that seasons the feast of digital experiences üçΩÔ∏è.

#### CSS and SCSS

Once upon a `webpage`, in the land of Odoo, where digital `designs` flourished like gardens in springtime, there existed a realm known as `CSS` and `SCSS`. Here, amidst the `cascading stylesheets` and the flavorful `SCSS mixins`, a tale of syntax, formatting, and naming conventions unfolded.

Imagine, if you will, the kitchen of a master chef, where every utensil has its designated place, and every recipe follows a precise order of preparation. Similarly, in the world of `CSS` and `SCSS`, `indentation` ruled with four-space indents, ensuring that each line of code stood in its rightful place, much like ingredients lined up on a chef's cutting board üçΩÔ∏è.

But let us delve deeper into this culinary adventure. Just as a chef meticulously orders the sequence of cooking steps, so too must the web developer organize `properties` in their `CSS` and `SCSS` files. From the outside in, starting with the position and ending with decorative rules, each declaration found its place in the `digital cookbook` üìú.

And what of the `naming conventions`, you ask? Much like labeling ingredients in jars, `CSS classes` were prefixed with `'o_'` followed by the `module name`, ensuring transparency and clarity in the code. Just as a chef avoids cluttering the kitchen with hyper-specific ingredients, web developers refrained from creating overly specific `classes`, opting instead for a more concise and `maintainable approach`.

But the true magic lay in the `variables` - the seasoning that brought flavor to the dish of `design`. In the world of Odoo, `SCSS variables` followed a sacred naming convention, ensuring `harmony` and `consistency` in the digital kitchen. Meanwhile, CSS variables danced across the `DOM`, adapting the design and layout to specific `contexts`, much like a skilled chef adjusting the recipe to suit the occasion.

As the tale unfolds, we witness the convergence of `CSS` and `SCSS`, blending the best of both worlds like a perfect fusion dish. `SCSS variables` laid the foundation of the `design system`, while `CSS variables` added a touch of `contextual adaptation`, creating a harmonious symphony of style.

And so, dear reader, as we bid adieu to this culinary journey through the world of CSS and SCSS, let us remember that much like cooking, `web development` is an art form where creativity and precision go hand in hand. üé®‚ú®

### Git guidelines

In the vast realm of Odoo, where developers journey through lines of code like explorers navigating uncharted lands, there exists a sacred tradition known as `Git guidelines`. Passed down through generations of programmers, these guidelines serve as a beacon of order amidst the ever-changing sea of code.

üåü Picture, if you will, a seasoned chef preparing a gourmet meal. Just as the chef meticulously organizes ingredients and follows a recipe, so too must developers configure their `Git settings`. By defining user `email` and `name`, developers establish their `identity` in the digital kitchen, ensuring that each `commit` carries their mark üç≥.

But what of the `commit message`, you ask? Much like a chef composing a menu, a commit message comprises four parts: tag, module, short description, and full description.

#### Tag and module name

üè∑Ô∏è `tags`, much like labels on different compartments of a toolbox. Each `tag` serves a specific `purpose`, from fixing `bugs` to adding new `features` or even `reverting` changes that have caused unforeseen `issues`. These tags provide clarity and organization, ensuring that every commit is categorized appropriately.

But `tags` alone are not enough. Just as a craftsman carefully selects the right tool for the job, developers must craft meaningful `commit message headers`.

#### Commit message header

Picture yourself as a storyteller, crafting the beginning of a tale that sets the stage for an epic journey. In the realm of Odoo development, every `commit message` is like the opening line of a story, offering insight into the `purpose behind each change`.

As the protagonist of this narrative, the `commit message header` takes center stage after the tag and module name. It's not just a label slapped onto a package, but rather a `concise summary` that hints at the adventure to come. 

Avoid the temptation to use vague terms like `"bugfix"` or `"improvements"` ‚Äì instead, strive for `clarity` and `brevity`. Imagine your header as the opening scene of a play, succinctly capturing the essence of the change in about `50 characters`. 

üåü `If applied, this commit will...` and let your `header` complete the sentence with clarity and purpose. Whether it's fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or making improvements, each `commit message` sets the tone for the next chapter in the development saga.

#### Commit message full description

Imagine yourself as a seasoned bard üé∂, weaving tales of `code changes` and development quests in the land of Odoo. Every commit message is like a chapter in a grand saga, telling the story of why and `how` the code was `transformed`.

As the hero of this narrative, the `commit message full description` holds great power. It serves as the guiding star for future adventurers üåü who may journey back to your commit in search of wisdom. 

Begin by unraveling the mystery behind your code modifications. `Why` did you embark on this quest? `What purpose` does your change serve in the greater scheme of things? 

Remember, `clarity` is your sword üó°Ô∏è, and `verbosity` your shield üõ°Ô∏è ‚Äì don't hesitate to share the tale behind your journey.

While the `commit` itself reveals the `technical changes`, the `commit message` is your chance to shed light on the path you've chosen. Were there any `forks` in the road? Any `crucial decisions` that led you to this point? Share your insights with future travelers üöÄ, for they may benefit from your wisdom.

Every `commit` should focus on a `single module`, avoiding the tangled webs of multi-module changes. By splitting your quests into `separate commits`, you create a clearer roadmap üó∫Ô∏è for future explorers, allowing them to navigate each `module's history` with ease.

And remember, fellow developer, the importance of your words cannot be overstated. Craft your `commit messages` with care, for they are the legacy you leave behind. Whether it's a `refactor`, a `bug fix`, or an `improvement`, let your message echo through the halls of code, guiding and inspiring those who follow in your footsteps.

And so, dear reader, as we conclude this tale of `Git guidelines` in Odoo, let us remember the lessons learned from the culinary world. Just as a well-crafted dish delights the palate, a well-composed `commit message` brings clarity and understanding to the realm of code. üñ•Ô∏èüçΩÔ∏è

### Chapter 2 : Views in Odoo 17 üåê

Views in Odoo are like different lenses through which you can look at your data. 

Imagine you have a treasure chest of information, and views are the various ways you can arrange and display that treasure to make it useful. 

Each model, which you can think of as a type of data collection (like contacts or sales orders), can have several views to present the same data differently. 

In Odoo Studio, views are grouped into four main categories: general, multiple records, timeline, and reporting. üåü

#### General Views üìã

### Chapter 3 : Models, Modules and Apps in Odoo 17 üõ†Ô∏è‚ú®

In the world of Odoo 17, models, modules, and apps are the fundamental `building blocks` of your data universe. 

Let's dive into their roles and how they shape your business processes, all in an easy-to-understand language.

#### Models: The Backbone of Your Data üìä

Imagine `models` as the skeletons of your database, defining its `structure` and how data is stored and manipulated.

Each model represents a table, and these tables are interconnected to represent various business concepts like sales orders, contacts, or products. 

Think of models as the blueprints for organizing your information logically and efficiently.

#### Modules and Apps: The Builders of Your System üß©

Modules and apps are like the construction workers that bring your blueprints to life. 

They contain all the necessary elements‚Äîmodels, views, data files, web controllers, and static web data‚Äîto create a functional and interactive system. 

While all apps are essentially modules, the term `"apps"` usually refers to larger, standalone modules, whereas other modules often act as add-ons to enhance these apps.

#### Turbocharge Your Development with Suggested Features ‚öôÔ∏èüöÄ

When creating a new model or app using `Odoo Studio`, you can opt for up to 14 `features` to streamline the process. 

These features bundle fields, default settings, and views commonly used together, offering standard `functionalities` from the get-go. 

Although most features can be added later, incorporating them early simplifies the model creation process and enhances their interaction.

#### Key Features to Enhance Your Models üåü

1. **Contact Details** üìá: Adds fields for linking to contacts, including phone and email, and activates the Map view.
2. **User Assignment** üë§: Allows assigning tasks to internal users and displaying their avatars.
3. **Date & Calendar** üìÖ: Introduces a Date field and activates the Calendar view.
4. **Date Range & Gantt** üóìÔ∏è: Adds start and end date fields and enables the Gantt view.
5. **Pipeline Stages** üìà: Activates the Kanban view with stages like New, In Progress, and Done.
6. **Tags** üè∑Ô∏è: Adds tagging capabilities to your forms and lists.
7. **Picture** üñºÔ∏è: Allows adding images to the top-right of forms.
8. **Lines** üìã: Incorporates a Lines field inside a Tab component.
9. **Notes** üìù: Introduces an HTML field for notes.
10. **Monetary Value** üí∞: Adds fields for monetary values and activates Graph and Pivot views.
11. **Company** üè¢: Useful for multi-company environments, adds a company field.
12. **Custom Sorting** üîÑ: Enables manual reordering of records with a drag handle.
13. **Chatter** üí¨: Adds messaging, note logging, and activity scheduling functionalities.
14. **Archiving** üì¶: Introduces the ability to archive records and hide them from searches by default.

#### Export and Import Customizations üåç

Once you've customized your models using Studio, you can export these customizations as a module named "`Studio customizations`".

This makes it easy to transfer your customizations to another database. 

Simply export your customizations from the main dashboard, download the `ZIP file`, and import it into the new database.

#### A Word of Caution ‚ö†Ô∏è

Before importing customizations, ensure that the destination `database` contains the `same apps` and modules as the source. 

Studio customizations do not automatically add underlying modules as dependencies.

With these tools and features at your disposal, crafting your data in Odoo 17 becomes a seamless and intuitive experience, even for those new to the world of databases. Happy building! üöÄ

### Chapter 4 : Automation Rules in Odoo 17 üõ†Ô∏è‚ú®

Imagine a world where your routine tasks are handled `automatically`, freeing up your time for more important work. 

This is the magic of `automation rules` in Odoo 17, where you can set up automatic changes triggered by user actions, email events, time conditions, or external events.

Let's explore how these automation rules work in a straightforward and simple way.

#### Getting Started with Automation Rules üéØ

To begin, open `Studio` and navigate to `Automations`.

Click on "`New`" to create a new rule. Choose your `Trigger`, fill in the necessary fields, and then define the action you want to occur. 

Save your rule, and you're done! It's as simple as that. üöÄ

#### Triggers: When Should the Automation Happen? üï∞Ô∏è

Triggers define when your automation rule will kick in.

There are five main types:

1. **Values Updated** üîÑ: Triggers based on changes to specific fields, like adding a tag or setting a user. 
2. **Email Events** üìß: Triggers when emails are sent or received. 
3. **Timing Conditions** üìÖ: Triggers based on dates, like sending a reminder before an event. 
4. **Custom** üìù: Triggers based on saving, deleting, or UI changes. 
5. **External** üåê: Triggers based on external events via webhooks. 

#### Setting Up Actions: What Should Happen? üõ†Ô∏è

Once you have defined your `trigger`, you need to specify what action should occur. 

Here are the types of actions you can set up:

1. **Update Record** ‚úçÔ∏è: Modify the fields of a record. 
2. **Create Activity** üìÖ: Schedule a new activity linked to the record. 
3. **Send Email and Send SMS** ‚úâÔ∏èüì≤: Automatically send emails or text messages. 
4. **Add Followers and Remove Followers** üë•: Manage who follows a record. 
5. **Create Record** üìÑ: Generate a new record in any model. 
6. **Execute Code** üíª: Run custom Python code. 
7. **Send Webhook Notification** üåê: Send data to an external system. 
8. **Execute Existing Actions** üîó: Trigger multiple actions at once. 

#### Advanced Features and Tips üí°

- **Before Update Domain** üîç: Set conditions that must be met before the automation rule is triggered. 
- **Extra Conditions** ‚úÖ: Add additional criteria that must be satisfied for the rule to execute. 
- **Logging** üìù: Keep track of the data sent by external systems to ensure everything runs smoothly. 

#### Practical Examples üåü

Let's say you want to automate the process of archiving old records. 

You could set up a timing condition to trigger this action 7 days after the last update. 

Or, if you need to send a reminder email 30 minutes before a meeting, you can create a timing condition based on the event's start time. ‚è∞üìß

![Studio Event Automated Action Capture](docs/images/studio-chap4-event.png)


#### Webhooks: Connecting with External Systems üåê

Webhooks are powerful tools for integrating Odoo with external systems. 

They work by sending HTTP(S) requests to a specified URL when certain events occur. 

This allows you to automate actions based on data from other applications, ensuring seamless communication between your systems. ü§ù

#### Conclusion

Automation rules in Odoo 17 are like having an assistant who handles `repetitive` tasks for you.

### Chapter 5 : PDF Reports in Odoo 17 üõ†Ô∏èüìÑ

Imagine having the power to create and `customize` PDF reports that perfectly reflect your company's style and needs. 

With Odoo 17's `Studio`, you can do just that, making professional and `personalized reports` for invoices, quotations, and more. 

Let's dive into this journey of transforming how you `present` your business `data`.

#### Default Layout: Setting the Stage üé®

The journey begins with setting up the default layout for your reports. 

Head to the Settings and under the Companies section, click **Configure Document Layout**. 

Here, you can choose from four `layouts`: Light, Boxed, Bold, and Striped. You can also select from seven fonts, such as Lato and Roboto, and upload your company logo. 

![Studio Document Layout Capture](docs/images/studio-chap5-layout.png)


Adjust the primary and secondary `colors`, choose a background (like Geometric or Custom), and add your company's tagline and details. 

This setup applies to all your reports, ensuring `consistency` across your documents. 

#### Creating New PDF Reports: Starting Fresh üìù

When you need a new report, navigate to the relevant model, toggle Studio, and click on **Reports**. 

Click **New**, and choose the type of report: `External` (with a company logo and footer details), `Internal` (with user and company info), or `Blank` (no header or footer). 

Once created, you can start editing the report to fit your needs.

#### Editing PDF Reports: Making It Your Own ‚úÇÔ∏è

To edit an existing report, select it from the Reports section in Studio. 

It's recommended to `duplicate` the standard report first, ensuring the original remains unchanged. 

![Studio Duplicate report Capture](docs/images/studio-chap5-duplicate.png)


Use the options on the left to `rename` the report, change its paper format, and set its `visibility` to specific user groups. 

You can also add the report to the **Print** menu and `reset` it to its default state if needed.

#### Report Editor: Tools at Your Fingertips üõ†Ô∏è

The `report editor` is where the real customization happens. You can `modify` formatting and content directly. 

Use commands to add fields, tables, images, and more. Type `/` to open the powerbox and choose what you need. 

![Studio Add Field to report Capture](docs/images/studio-chap5-addfield.png)

For instance, add a field by selecting the **Field** command, find the field you want, and insert it. 

Similarly, add `data table`s to display relational fields, and format your text using the text editor.

#### Conditional Blocks and Dynamic Content üîÑ

Conditional blocks (dashed rectangles) let you show or hide content based on specific conditions. 

For example, display different information depending on the status of an order. 

These `conditions` are set in `XML`, but you can `preview` and adjust them in the editor.

Dynamic text, highlighted in blue, automatically updates with field values when the report is generated. 

For instance, the SO number or quotation date will appear `dynamically` in the final report.

#### Advanced Customization: Editing XML üíª

For those needing advanced customization, you can edit the report's `XML` directly. 

This allows for precise `control` over the report's structure and content. 

However, be `cautious`, as direct XML edits might cause issues during system upgrades. If problems arise, simply copy your changes from the old `database` into the new one.

#### Conclusion üöÄ

Creating and editing PDF reports in Odoo 17 is like painting a masterpiece. 

With Studio, you have the tools to craft documents that are not only `functional` but also `beautifully` tailored to your business's identity. 

From setting up the default `layout` to diving deep into `XML` edits, Odoo empowers you to present your `data` in the best possible light. 

Start your journey today and see how easy it is to create stunning `reports` that make an impact. üöÄüìä

![odoo.sh signin Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap2-signin.png)


#### 3. Authorize Odoo.sh ‚úÖ

You'll need to `authorize` Odoo.sh to access your GitHub account. 

![odoo.sh authorize Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap2-authorize.png)


This is crucial because Odoo.sh needs permissions to:
- `Know` your GitHub login and email.
- `Create` a new `repository` if you‚Äôre starting from scratch.
- `Read` your existing repositories if you‚Äôre using one.
- `Create` a `webhook` for updates when you push changes.
- `Commit` changes to streamline your deployment.

#### 4. Submit Your Project üìù

Decide whether to start from scratch or use an existing `repository`. Then, name your repository or select an existing one and choose the `Odoo version` you want to use. 

If you have a `subscription code`, enter it here. This code is tied to your `Enterprise subscription`, which includes `Odoo.sh`.

![odoo.sh submit Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap2-submit.png)


If your subscription isn't valid, it could mean:
- It doesn't exist.
- It‚Äôs not a partnership subscription.
- It‚Äôs an Enterprise subscription that doesn't include `Odoo.sh`.
- It‚Äôs another type of subscription (e.g., online subscription).

If you're unsure, contact `Odoo support` for assistance.

#### 5. You're Done! üéâ

Your platform is now being created. Soon, you'll be able to connect to your first `database`.

![odoo.sh done Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap2-done.png)


#### Importing Your Database üì•

You can import your database into your `Odoo.sh` project if it‚Äôs a supported version.

#### Pushing Your Modules to Production üõ†Ô∏è

For `custom` or community `modules`, add them to a branch in your GitHub repository. `Odoo.sh` will detect the folders containing `Odoo addons`. 

You can structure your `modules` as you like, either at the root or in categorized folders.

For publicly available community modules, consider adding them as `submodules`. Make this branch your production branch or merge it into an existing one.

#### Downloading a Backup üíæ

##### On-Premise Databases üñ•Ô∏è

Access the URL `/web/database/manager` of your on-premise database and download a backup. 

![odoo.sh download Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap2-download.png)

### Chapter 3 : Odoo.sh Branches üåø

Imagine you‚Äôre an explorer, setting up your adventure base camp with `Odoo.sh`. 

Here‚Äôs your journey through managing `branches` in a way that's easy to grasp, even if you‚Äôre new to the tech world.

#### Discovering Your Branches üå≤

Your repository is like a tree, and branches are its limbs, each holding different parts of your project. 

The `branches` view gives you a map of these limbs, helping you see where each one stands.

![odoo.sh branches Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap3-branches.png)

#### The Three Stages: Production, Staging, and Development üöÄ

Think of your branches moving through three main stages: production, staging, and development.

![odoo.sh stages Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap3-stages.png)

##### 1. **Production Branch: The Heartbeat of Your Project ‚ù§Ô∏è**
The `production` branch is your `main` branch, where your live project runs. It‚Äôs like the main base camp where everything is `up` and `running`. 

When you `push` new `changes` here, your server updates and restarts to include the latest `improvements`. If there‚Äôs a hitch, the system `rolls back` to the last working `version`, ensuring everything stays smooth.

##### 2. **Staging Branch: Your Testing Ground üß™**

`Staging` branches are your `testing` grounds, safe zones where you test `new features` using `real data` without affecting your `main` base camp. 

Here, scheduled actions are `paused`, emails are `intercepted`, and services like payments are set to `test mode`. 

It‚Äôs like `practicing` a drill before the actual adventure.

##### 3. **Development Branch: The Workshop üõ†Ô∏è**

`Development` branches are your `workshops`. They use `demo data` to run tests and ensure your `new changes` don‚Äôt break anything. 

When you `push` updates here, a new `environment` is created from scratch, loaded with `demo data`, and all `tests` are run automatically.

#### Merging Branches: Bringing It All Together üîÑ

`Merging` branches in `Odoo.sh` is like combining paths in your map. You can `drag` and `drop` branches into each other to merge them. 

![odoo.sh merging Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap3-merging.png)

For example:
- To `test` new changes, `merge` your development branch into a staging branch.
- When changes are ready for live use, `merge` your staging branch into the production branch.

You can also use `git merge` commands if you prefer working directly from your workstation.

#### Additional Tools and Tabs üõ†Ô∏èüìä

##### **History: The Journal of Your Journey üìú**

This tab records every change, commit, and event, like a detailed `journal` of your adventure. 

You can see `who` made changes, `what` was changed, and the `outcome` of each event.

![odoo.sh history Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap3-history.png)

##### **Mails: Capturing the Communication üìß**

The `mail catcher` tab shows all the emails sent from your database, but only for development and staging branches, ensuring no `test emails` bother your real contacts.

![odoo.sh mails Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap3-mails.png)

##### **Shell: Command Center üñ•Ô∏è**

This is your command center, where you can run `basic commands` and open a shell to interact directly with your database.

![odoo.sh shell Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap3-shell.png)


##### **Editor: Your Coding Canvas üé®**

The `online` integrated development environment (`IDE`) is where you write and edit your code. It supports multiple tabs and various tools to streamline your development process.

![odoo.sh editor Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap3-editor.png)


##### **Monitoring: Keeping an Eye on Things üëÄ**

Here, you‚Äôll find graphs and `metrics` monitoring your `builds`. You can zoom in, adjust time ranges, and see annotations related to changes.

![odoo.sh monitoring Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap3-monitoring.png)


##### **Logs: The Chronicles of Your Server üìö**

The `logs` tab shows detailed records of server activities. You can view `logs` for installations, updates, and server `operations`.

![odoo.sh logs Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap3-logs.png)

##### **Backups: Safety Nets üõ°Ô∏è**

Backups are your safety nets. `Odoo.sh` automatically `backs up` your `production` database `daily`, keeping copies for a `month`. You can also manually create backups before `major changes` to ensure you have a `restore point` if things go awry.

![odoo.sh backup Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap3-backup.png)

#### Branch Settings: Tailoring Your Adventure ‚öôÔ∏è

In the settings tab, you can `customize` how branches behave upon new commits, select modules to install, enable or disable tests, and set the `Odoo` version. 

You can also configure `custom domains` and ensure your outgoing emails comply with `SPF` and `DKIM` standards for better deliverability.

![odoo.sh domains Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap3-domains.png)

![odoo.sh behavior Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap3-behavior.png)

By following this storytelling approach, you‚Äôll navigate through `Odoo.sh` branches with ease, understanding each step as part of your exciting journey into `Odoo` development. üåü

### Chapter 4 : Odoo.sh Builds üåø

Imagine you're setting up a project base in `Odoo.sh`. Here‚Äôs your journey through understanding and managing `builds`, explained in a way that even beginners can follow.

#### What Are Builds? üèóÔ∏è

In `Odoo.sh`, a build is like a `test run` of your project. It involves loading your database on an Odoo server within a `containerized` environment. 

Think of it as a rehearsal to ensure everything works smoothly.

#### The Build Overview üõ†Ô∏è

In the builds view, each `row` represents a `branch` of your project, and each `cell` in that row represents a `build` of that branch.

![odoo.sh overview Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap4-overview.png)

##### When Builds Are Created üìÖ

Builds are typically created whenever you `push` updates to your GitHub `repository` branches. They can also occur when you `import` a database into `Odoo.sh` or manually trigger a `rebuild` for a branch.

##### Build Status üö¶
- **Successful Builds** üü¢: Highlighted in `green`, meaning no errors or warnings.
- **Failed Builds** üî¥: Highlighted in `red`, indicating errors occurred.
- **Almost Successful Builds** üü°: Highlighted in `yellow`, showing warnings but no critical errors.

#### How Builds Work üåç

Builds don't always start a database from scratch. 

For example, `pushing` changes to the production branch starts the server with your new `revision` and tries to load the `current` production database. If it works without errors, it's successful.

#### The Three Build Stages: Production, Staging, and Development üöÄ

##### 1. **Production Stage: The Main Base Camp üèïÔ∏è**

The first `build` of your production branch creates the `main` database. Subsequent `pushes` create new builds that attempt to `update` this database with the `latest` changes. 

If a build `fails`, the system reverts to the last `successful` build to keep everything running smoothly.

##### 2. **Staging Stage: The Testing Ground üß™**

`Staging` builds create `copies` of your production database. Each `new push` on a staging branch uses a `fresh copy`, ensuring you test with `up-to-date` data. 

Changes made here don‚Äôt affect the `production` database, so you can experiment freely. Remember, `configuration` changes in staging don‚Äôt carry over unless `applied` to production.

##### 3. **Development Stage: The Workshop üõ†Ô∏è**

Development builds create `new` databases with `demo data` and run `unit tests`. 

These tests check for `errors`, and a build is marked as `failed` if any tests fail. Successful builds mean all tests `passed` without issues. 

Depending on the number of modules, these builds can take up to an `hour`.

#### Navigating Builds and Branches üå≥

##### Features üõ°Ô∏è

- **Production Branch**: Always appears first, followed by other branches `sorted` by the last build created. You can `filter` branches to find what you need.
- ![odoo.sh features Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap4-features.png)
- **Accessing Builds**: Use the `Connect` link to access a build‚Äôs database. Jump to the `branch code` with the `GitHub` link. You can create a `new build` with the latest revision using the `rebuild` link, provided no other build is in progress.
- ![odoo.sh accessing Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap4-accessing.png)

##### Build Details üîç

For each build:
- **Revision Changes**: Click the GitHub icon to see what changed.
- **Database Access**: Use the `Connect` button to access the database as an `admin`. The dropdown menu lets you `connect as` another user, check logs, use the web shell, edit code, manage outgoing emails, and download a database dump.
- ![odoo.sh menu Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap4-menu.png)

By following this storytelling approach, you‚Äôll navigate through `Odoo.sh` builds with ease, understanding each step as part of your exciting journey into Odoo development. üåü

### Chapter 6 :  **Settings** Tab in Odoo.sh üìñ

Imagine you're the captain of a ship navigating through the vast ocean of project management on `Odoo.sh`. The **Settings** tab is your control room, where you configure and fine-tune everything to ensure smooth sailing.

![odoo.sh settings Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap6-settings.png)


#### Project Name and Address üåê

First, you name your ship. This name sets the address where your production database can be accessed. 

It's like giving your ship a **unique identifier**. When you rename your project, future builds will sail under this new name, but past voyages retain their original names.

![odoo.sh name Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap6-name.png)

#### Collaborators üöÄ

![odoo.sh Collaborators Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap6-collaborators.png)

Your crew is essential for a successful voyage. You manage your crew through the **Collaborators** section. There are two types of crew members:

1. **Admins**: They have full access to all features on `Odoo.sh`, akin to your first mates who can navigate any part of the ship.
2. **Users**: These are like your deckhands, skilled in coding but restricted from accessing **sensitive** areas like the production data or the ship‚Äôs logs.

**Admins** can use all tools available, while **Users** can only modify code without touching the critical data.

![odoo.sh Collaborators Types Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap6-collaborators-types.png)


#### Public Access üóùÔ∏è

Sometimes, you might want to show off your ship's development progress to the public.By enabling **Public Access**, you allow visitors to view your development builds, logs, shell, and emails. 

![odoo.sh Access Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap6-access.png)

However, your production and staging areas remain off-limits, maintaining their security.

#### Custom Domains üåç

If you want your ship to be recognized by multiple names (domains), you can configure this in the **Custom Domains** section. Each branch of your project can be assigned a different domain, making your ship known by various identities.

#### Submodules üß©

Your ship may rely on additional resources from private repositories. To access these, you need to set up **Deploy Keys**. 

This is like giving special **permission** to retrieve secret supplies from these private sources. You provide the `SSH URL` of the private repository, add it, and then copy and paste the `public key` to the repository's settings.

![odoo.sh submodules Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap6-submodules.png)


#### Storage Size üì¶

Every ship needs to monitor its cargo. The **Storage Size** section shows how much space your project is using, including the `PostgreSQL` database and disk files in your container. 

![odoo.sh storage Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap6-storage.png)


If you exceed your storage limits, the system automatically synchronizes with your subscription to accommodate the growth.

#### Database Workers üõ†Ô∏è

To handle more tasks simultaneously, you can add more **Database Workers**. This is like hiring additional crew members to manage the increased workload. 

![odoo.sh workers Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap6-workers.png)

However, it‚Äôs important to note that adding more workers won‚Äôt solve all performance issues; sometimes the problem lies deeper within the code.

#### Staging Branches üå±

You can develop and test multiple features at once by adding more **Staging Branches**. 

![odoo.sh staging Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap6-staging.png)


This allows you to conduct various experiments without interfering with your main operations, ensuring that your ship's journey remains uninterrupted.

#### Activation üîë

Finally, the **Activation** section shows the status of your project's activation. Here, you can change the activation code if needed, ensuring that your ship remains operational and ready to sail.

![odoo.sh activation Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap6-activation.png)

#### Conclusion üåÖ

The **Settings** tab in Odoo.sh is your essential toolkit for managing and configuring your project. By carefully adjusting these settings, you can ensure that your project runs smoothly and efficiently, just like a well-navigated ship on a successful voyage. üöÄ

### Chapter 7 : Online Editor in Odoo.sh ‚ú®

#### Overview

Imagine you're about to dive into the world of Odoo 17. With Odoo.sh, you have a powerful online editor at your fingertips, accessible right from your web browser üåê. 

![odoo.sh editor Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap7-editor.png)

This editor allows you to modify the source code of your builds, open terminals, Python consoles, Odoo Shell consoles, and even Notebooks üìö.

#### Accessing the Editor

Getting to the editor is straightforward üöÄ. You can reach it through the branches tabs, the builds dropdown menu, or by adding `/odoo-sh/editor` to your build's domain name.

#### Editing the Source Code

![odoo.sh editing Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap7-editing.png)

Within the editor, you find a structured working directory üóÇÔ∏è:

- **home/odoo/src/**: Contains the source codes for Odoo Community, Odoo Enterprise, Odoo Themes, and your repository branch.
- **home/odoo/data/**: Holds database attachments and user session files.
- **home/odoo/logs/**: Keeps logs for database installations, server runs, database updates, and Python package installations.

You can edit the source code in development and staging builds. However, remember that any changes you make won't persist unless you commit them to your source code üìù.

#### Making and Saving Changes

To edit a file, just double-click it in the file browser üñ±Ô∏è. Save your changes via the File menu or with the Ctrl+S shortcut üíæ. 

![odoo.sh saving Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap7-saving.png)

If you save a Python file within the Odoo server addons path, Odoo will automatically reload it to reflect your changes instantly. For changes stored in the database, like field labels or views, you'll need to update the corresponding module üîÑ.


#### Committing and Pushing Changes

![odoo.sh pushing Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap7-pushing.png)

Once you're satisfied with your changes, you can commit and push them to your GitHub repository üì§:

1. Open a terminal (File ‚Ä£ New ‚Ä£ Terminal) üíª.
2. Navigate to your user directory: `cd ~/src/user` üìÇ.
3. Stage your changes: `git add` üìã.
4. Commit your changes: `git commit` ‚úÖ.
5. Push your changes: `git push https HEAD:<branch>` üöÄ.

Use the HTTPS remote of your GitHub repository, as SSH authentication isn't possible through the web-based editor üîê. 

If you have two-factor authentication on GitHub, use a personal access token as your password üîë.

#### Working with Consoles

The editor also provides Python and Odoo Shell consoles üêç. Python consoles offer rich display capabilities, allowing you to visualize objects in HTML üåê. 

![odoo.sh console Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap7-console.png)

For example, you can use pandas to display cells of a CSV file üìä.

![odoo.sh pandas Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap7-pandas.png)

In the Odoo Shell console, you can interact with the Odoo registry and model methods of your database üõ†Ô∏è. 

![odoo.sh registry Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap7-registry.png)

Be cautious, as changes are automatically committed to the database ‚ö†Ô∏è. You can invoke database models using `env` and display lists and dicts prettily with the `Pretty` class üåü.

### Chapter 8 : Your first module with Odoo.sh üöÄ

#### Overview

In this chapter, we'll walk you through creating your very first Odoo module and deploying it in your Odoo.sh project. 

It's a straightforward process, even if you're new to Git and GitHub. Let's get started! üåü

#### Getting Ready

Before diving in, make sure you have:

1. A project on Odoo.sh.
2. Your GitHub repository URL.

We'll assume the following setup:

- `~/src` is your directory for Odoo projects.
- `odoo` is the GitHub user.
- `odoo-addons` is the GitHub repository.
- `feature-1` is your development branch.
- `master` is your production branch.
- `my_module` is your module name.

Feel free to replace these with your own values.

#### Creating the Development Branch

![odoo.sh creating Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap8-creating.png)
![odoo.sh creating Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap8-creating1.png)

*From Odoo.sh:*

1. Go to the branches view.
2. Click the + button next to the development stage.
3. Choose the `master` branch in the Fork selection.
4. Type `feature-1` in the "To" input field.

*From Your Computer:*

1. Open your terminal and clone your GitHub repository:

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/src
    cd ~/src
    git clone https://github.com/odoo/odoo-addons.git
    cd ~/src/odoo-addons
    ```

2. Create a new branch:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature-1 master
    ```

#### Creating the Module Structure

*Scaffolding the Module:*

1. Open a terminal in the Odoo.sh editor or your computer.
2. Run the scaffolding command:

    ```bash
    odoo-bin scaffold my_module ~/src/user/
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    ./odoo-bin scaffold my_module ~/src/odoo-addons/
    ```

This generates the basic structure for your module, making it easier to get started.

#### Module Structure:

- `my_module/`
  - `__init__.py`
  - `__manifest__.py`
  - `controllers/`
    - `__init__.py`
    - `controllers.py`
  - `demo/`
    - `demo.xml`
  - `models/`
    - `__init__.py`
    - `models.py`
  - `security/`
    - `ir.model.access.csv`
  - `views/`
    - `templates.xml`
    - `views.xml`

#### Editing the Module Files

Uncomment the content in the following files to define your module‚Äôs behavior:

- `models/models.py`
- `views/views.xml`
- `demo/demo.xml`
- `controllers/controllers.py`
- `views/templates.xml`
- `__manifest__.py`

#### Pushing Your Changes

1. Stage your changes:

    ```bash
    git add my_module
    ```

2. Commit your changes:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "My first module"
    ```

3. Push your changes to GitHub:

    *From Odoo.sh:*

    ```bash
    git push https HEAD:feature-1
    ```

    *From your computer:*

    ```bash
    git push -u origin feature-1
    ```

#### Testing Your Module

Your new branch should appear in your project's development branches. 

![odoo.sh testing Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap8-testing.png)

You can test your module by accessing the development build and creating new records to see how your features work.

#### Testing with Production Data

1. Make your development branch a staging branch or merge it into an existing staging branch.

![odoo.sh testing production Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap8-testing-prod.png)
![odoo.sh testing staging Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap8-testing-stag.png)

2. This creates a new staging build using the latest changes from your branch.

![odoo.sh build staging Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap8-build.png)

#### Deploying to Production

Once you're satisfied with your module's performance in staging, merge your branch into the production branch. 

![odoo.sh deploy Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap8-deploy.png)

This will update your production server with the latest changes.

![odoo.sh update Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap8-update.png)

#### Adding a Change

To add a new field to your module:

1. Open `models/models.py` and add:

    ```python
    start_datetime = fields.Datetime('Start time', default=lambda self: fields.Datetime.now())
    ```

2. Open `views/views.xml` and add:

    ```xml
    <field name="start_datetime"/>
    ```

3. Update the module version in `__manifest__.py`:

    ```python
    'version': '0.2',
    ```

4. Stage, commit, and push your changes:

    ```bash
    git add my_module
    git commit -m "[ADD] my_module: add start_datetime field"
    git push https HEAD:feature-1
    ```

The platform will then create a new build for the branch feature-1.

![odoo.sh adding change Capture](docs/images/odoosh-chap8-adding.png)

#### Using an External Python Library

To use an external library like Unidecode:

1. Create a `requirements.txt` file and add:

    ```plaintext
    unidecode
    ```

2. Use the library in your module:

    ```python
    from unidecode import unidecode

    @api.model
    def create(self, values):
        if 'name' in values:
            values['name'] = unidecode(values['name'])
        return super(my_module, self).create(values)

    def write(self, values):
        if 'name' in values:
            values['name'] = unidecode(values['name'])
        return super(my_module, self).write(values)
    ```

3. Update the module version to `0.3` in `__manifest__.py`.
4. Stage, commit, and push your changes.

With these steps, you've created your first Odoo module, tested it, and deployed it in production. 

Congratulations! üéâ

### Chapter 1: Define Module Data üìä

After creating your first module with Odoo.sh, it's time to dive deeper into managing the data that powers your module. This chapter will guide you through the types of data you can define and how to structure and declare them effectively within your Odoo module.

#### Data Types üìë

In Odoo, data is categorized into two main types: **Master Data** and **Demo Data**.

**Master Data** is essential for the module to function correctly. It includes technical data like views and actions and business data such as countries, currencies, and legal reports. This data is automatically installed with the module.

**Demo Data** is used for demonstration and testing purposes. It helps sales representatives perform demos, allows developers to test new features, and ensures that data loads correctly without errors. Demo data is loaded automatically unless you specify otherwise.

#### Data Declaration üìù

To declare data in your module, you need to include it in the module's manifest file. Data can be declared in CSV or XML format, with each file listed under the appropriate key in the manifest.

**Manifest Example:**

```python
{
    "name": "Real Estate",
    "depends": ["base"],
    "data": [
        "security/ir.model.access.csv",
        "views/estate_property_offer_views.xml",
        "data/master_data.xml",
    ],
    "demo": [
        "demo/demo_data.xml",
    ],
    "application": True,
}
```

#### CSV Data üìÑ

CSV files are ideal for simple, long lists of data. They are easy to create and maintain but are limited in functionality compared to XML.

**CSV Example:**

```plaintext
id,field_a,field_b,related_id:id
id1,valueA1,valueB1,module.relatedid
id2,valueA2,valueB2,module.relatedid
```

#### XML Data üóÇÔ∏è

XML is more flexible and powerful, suitable for complex data structures. It allows you to create detailed records and link related data.

**XML Example:**

```xml
<odoo>
  <record id="id1" model="tutorial.example">
    <field name="field_a">valueA1</field>
    <field name="field_b">valueB1</field>
  </record>

  <record id="id2" model="tutorial.example">
    <field name="field_a">valueA2</field>
    <field name="field_b">valueB2</field>
  </record>
</odoo>
```

#### Extending Data üõ†Ô∏è

In Odoo, you can extend existing data by adding new fields or enhancing current ones without replacing the original data. Use the `xml_id` of existing records to integrate new information seamlessly.

**Extending Example:**

```xml
<odoo>
  <record id="id1" model="tutorial.example">
    <field name="field_c">valueC1</field>
  </record>
</odoo>
```

#### Accessing Data üîç

Accessing data in Odoo can be done through Python code, XML references, or CSV declarations. Always code defensively, considering that data can be altered or deleted by users.

**Accessing Data Example in XML:**

```xml
<odoo>
  <record id="id1" model="tutorial.example">
    <field name="related_id" ref="module.relatedid"/>
  </record>
</odoo>
```

**Accessing Data Example in CSV:**

```plaintext
id,parent_id:id,name
"child1","module.parent","Name1"
"child2","module.parent","Name2"
```

#### Advanced Techniques üí°

Understanding XML ids, the `noupdate` flag, and the use of raw SQL for data import are advanced techniques that can enhance your data management skills. However, these should be used cautiously to maintain data integrity and security.

**No Update Example:**

The records created with the noupdate flag won‚Äôt be updated when upgrading the module that created them, but it will be created if it didn‚Äôt exist yet.

```xml
<odoo noupdate="1">
  <record id="id1" model="model">
    <field name="fieldA" eval="True"/>
  </record>
</odoo>
```

By mastering these data management techniques, you'll ensure your Odoo modules are robust, flexible, and reliable, paving the way for more advanced development in the Odoo ecosystem. üöÄ

### Chapter 2: Restrict Access to Data üîê

Building on the foundation of module data, this chapter delves into securing your module by restricting access to data. 

Ensuring that only authorized users can view or manipulate certain data is critical for maintaining business `integrity` and `confidentiality`.

#### Introduction to Security Concerns üõ°Ô∏è

In most business environments, security is a key concern. 

**Without proper restrictions:**

- Any employee can create, read, update, or delete properties, property types, or property tags.
- Unauthorized third parties might access sensitive property data.
- Non-agents could view or modify property details.
- Agents might inadvertently alter property types or tags that they shouldn‚Äôt.
- Exclusive properties could be managed by unauthorized agents.
- Agents could confirm sales without proper invoicing permissions.

To address these issues, you need to implement security measures that limit access based on user roles and responsibilities.

#### Using Groups to Manage Access üë•

Odoo uses `groups` to manage `access rights` and roles. Groups link security rules to users, simplifying the process of assigning and managing permissions.

**Example Groups:**

- **Real Estate Managers**: Can configure the system, manage all property types and tags, and oversee all properties.
- **Real Estate Agents**: Can manage properties under their care and confirm sales but cannot modify property types or tags.

Groups are defined in the module‚Äôs `data` files and are crucial for maintaining structured access control.

#### Exercise: Creating Security Groups üèóÔ∏è

1. **Create the `security.xml` file** in the appropriate folder.
2. **Add to `__manifest__.py`**: Include the `security.xml` file and set the category field to `Real Estate/Brokerage`.
3. **Define Groups**:
    ```xml
    <odoo>
      <record id="estate_group_user" model="res.groups">
        <field name="name">Agent</field>
        <field name="category_id" ref="base.module_category_real_estate_brokerage"/>
      </record>
      <record id="estate_group_manager" model="res.groups">
        <field name="name">Manager</field>
        <field name="category_id" ref="base.module_category_real_estate_brokerage"/>
        <field name="implied_ids" eval="[(4, ref('estate_group_user'))]"/>
      </record>
    </odoo>
    ```

4. **Restart Odoo and update the module** to apply changes.
5. **Assign the Real Estate Manager role** to the admin user and create a new user with the Real Estate Agent role via the web interface.

#### Access Rights Configuration üõÇ

Access rights allow you to control what users can do with specific models.

**Example Access Rights Configuration**:

- **Real Estate Managers**: Full access to all objects.
- **Real Estate Agents**: Read-only access to property types and tags, no delete rights for properties.

Update your access rights file to reflect these rules and verify by testing with different user roles.

#### Implementing Record Rules üìú

Record rules offer `granular` control over access to individual records.

**Example Record Rule**:
```xml
<record id="rule_id" model="ir.rule">
  <field name="name">Agent Rule</field>
  <field name="model_id" ref="estate.property"/>
  <field name="perm_read" eval="True"/>
  <field name="perm_write" eval="True"/>
  <field name="perm_create" eval="True"/>
  <field name="perm_unlink" eval="False"/>
  <field name="groups" eval="[(4, ref('estate_group_user'))]"/>
  <field name="domain_force">[
    '|', ('user_id', '=', user.id),
         ('user_id', '=', False)
  ]</field>
</record>
```
This rule ensures that agents can only see or modify properties they manage.

#### Security Override and Explicit Checks üö®

In some cases, you may need to `bypass` security checks for specific operations. Use `sudo()` to temporarily ignore access rights and record rules.

**Example**:
```python
property.sudo().write({'state': 'sold'})
```

Always implement explicit security checks to validate user permissions before bypassing security mechanisms. Use methods like `check_access_rights` and `check_access_rule` to ensure the current user has appropriate permissions.

#### Multi-Company Security üåê

For businesses operating across multiple companies, enforce multi-company rules to restrict access based on the user's company.

```python
    def action_sold_property(self):
        # Call the super method to perform the default action_sold_property logic
        result = super().action_sold_property()

        # Ensure the current user has access rights to update properties
        self.check_access_rights('write')
        self.check_access_rule('write')

        ...

        self.env['account.move'].sudo().create(move_values)

        return result
```
**Example Multi-Company Rule**:
```xml
<record model="ir.rule" id="multi_company_rule">
  <field name="name">Multi-Company Rule</field>
  <field name="model_id" ref="estate.property"/>
  <field name="domain_force">[
    '|', ('company_id', '=', False),
         ('company_id', 'in', company_ids)
  ]</field>
</record>
```
Ensure each property has a `company_id` and restrict agents to viewing only properties of their assigned company.

#### Visibility vs. Security üîçüîí

Differentiate between visibility and security:

- **Visibility**: Controls what is shown in the user interface but doesn‚Äôt restrict access.
- **Security**: Restricts access to data and operations, ensuring unauthorized users cannot interact with them.

**Example**:
- **Visibility**: Hide the Settings menu for agents.
- **Security**: Prevent agents from accessing the Property Types and Property Tags menus.

By following these guidelines, you'll create a secure, well-structured Odoo module, ensuring that users have access to only the data and functions necessary for their roles.

---

### Chapter 3: Safeguard Your Code with Unit Tests üß™

Building upon the security measures from the previous chapter, we now delve into the realm of unit testing. Just as security ensures data integrity and confidentiality, unit tests ensure the `stability` and `reliability` of your code.

#### Why Write Tests? üìù

Imagine you're constructing a skyscraper. Each floor must be sturdy before you build the next one. Similarly, unit tests are the `foundation blocks` of your code, ensuring each part functions correctly before adding new features.

**Benefits of Writing Tests:**

- **Future-proofing:** Ensures that changes or new features don't break existing functionality.
- **Scope definition:** Clearly defines what your code is supposed to do.
- **Use case documentation:** Provides practical examples of how your code should be used.
- **Technical documentation:** Offers insights into how the code operates.
- **Goal-setting:** Helps in defining the objectives before starting the development.

#### Running Tests: The Essentials üèÉ

Before writing tests, it's crucial to know how to execute them. Picture yourself at the command line, the control center of your coding environment.

To see the available options, use:
```bash
odoo-bin -h
```

Key options for testing include:

- `--test-enable`: Activates unit tests.
- `--test-file=TEST_FILE`: Runs a specific test file.
- `--test-tags=TEST_TAGS`: Filters tests based on tags.

To run all tests for the `account` module:
```bash
odoo-bin -i account --test-enable
```

Or, to run a specific test file:
```bash
odoo-bin --test-file=addons/account/tests/test_account_move_entry.py
```

#### Continuous Integration (CI): Your Automated Ally ü§ñ

In Odoo, `CI` ensures that your code remains `stable` and bug-free. Each time you `push` a commit to GitHub, tools like `Runbot` come into play, automatically running tests to verify the code.

**Runbot Insights:**

- **Commit status:** Monitors the state of each commit.
- **Batches and builds:** A batch includes multiple builds, and a build checks the community and enterprise versions.
- **Green signal:** A build passes if all tests are successful.

By integrating CI into your workflow, you can catch issues early, ensuring smooth and stable code deployment.

#### Writing Tests: The First Line of Defense üõ°Ô∏è

Writing tests is like training a guard dog. They should be `independent` and leave `no traces` once done. For instance, if you're fixing a bug, your test should `fail` before the fix and `pass` afterward.

**Test Structure:**

Organize tests within your module, similar to how you'd structure the rooms in a house:
```
estate
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ *.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_*.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __manifest__.py
```

Each test file should start with `test_` and be imported in the `__init__.py` of the tests folder. Tests extend `odoo.tests.common.TransactionCase`, and you usually define a `setUpClass` method to create test data.

**Example Test Case:**
```python
from odoo.tests.common import TransactionCase
from odoo.exceptions import UserError
from odoo.tests import tagged

@tagged('post_install', '-at_install')
class EstateTestCase(TransactionCase):

    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        super(EstateTestCase, cls).setUpClass()
        cls.properties = cls.env['estate.property'].create([...])

    def test_creation_area(self):
        self.properties.living_area = 20
        self.assertRecordValues(self.properties, [
           {'name': ..., 'total_area': ...},
        ])

    def test_action_sell(self):
        self.properties.action_sold()
        self.assertRecordValues(self.properties, [
           {'name': ..., 'state': ...},
        ])
```

#### Ensuring Stability Through Tests üîç

Create tests to prevent scenarios where:
- An offer is created for a sold property.
- A property is sold without accepted offers.

These tests act as gatekeepers, ensuring only valid operations are performed. 

#### Continuous Improvement and Integration ü§ù

With experience, tools like `Robodoo` and `Mergebot` become valuable allies. They help manage code changes, ensuring smooth merges and maintaining code quality.

By writing and running tests, you ensure your code stands strong, just like a well-built skyscraper. With these practices, you can confidently expand your Odoo module, knowing that each addition is safeguarded by your tests.

### Chapter 1: Module Manifests üìú

Building on the foundation oF previous chapters, we now turn our attention to an essential component in Odoo development‚Äîthe manifest file.

This file is the `passport` of your `module`, formally declaring it to Odoo and detailing its key `attributes`.

#### The Heart of a Module: `__manifest__.py` ‚ù§Ô∏è

Every Odoo module proudly wears its identity in a file named `__manifest__.py`. This file is a simple Python dictionary containing various `metadata` about the module. 

```python
{
    'name': "A Module",
    'version': '1.0',
    'depends': ['base'],
    'author': "Author Name",
    'category': 'Category',
    'description': """
    Description text
    """,
    # data files always loaded at installation
    'data': [
        'views/mymodule_view.xml',
    ],
    # data files containing optionally loaded demonstration data
    'demo': [
        'demo/demo_data.xml',
    ],
}
```

Let‚Äôs explore the vital elements that compose this dictionary:

**Name and Version:**
- **`name`** üè∑Ô∏è: This is the human-readable name of your module. It‚Äôs the first thing users will see, so choose wisely!
- **`version`** üìÖ: Following semantic versioning rules, this specifies the version of your module, aiding in tracking updates and compatibility.

**Description and Author:**
- **`description`** üìù: Provides an extended description of your module, typically written in reStructuredText. This helps users understand what the module does.
- **`author`** ‚úçÔ∏è: The name of the person or organization that developed the module.

**Website and License:**
- **`website`** üåê: A URL for more information about the module or its author.
- **`license`** üìú: Specifies the distribution license for your module. Options include various GPL versions, LGPL-3, and proprietary licenses among others.

**Category and Dependencies:**
- **`category`** üóÇÔ∏è: Classifies the module within Odoo, making it easier to find. While using existing categories is recommended, you can create new ones if necessary.
- **`depends`** üîó: Lists other Odoo modules that need to be installed first, ensuring all required features and resources are available.

**Data and Demo Files:**
- **`data`** üìÇ: A list of data files that must always be loaded with the module. These are the core files needed for the module to function.
- **`demo`** üé®: A list of demonstration data files that are loaded only in demo mode, useful for showcasing module features.

**Automatic Installation and External Dependencies:**
- **`auto_install`** üîÑ: If set to True, the module will be automatically installed if all its dependencies are present. This is useful for modules that provide integration between other modules.
- **`external_dependencies`** ‚öôÔ∏è: A dictionary listing Python and/or binary dependencies required by the module. This ensures all necessary components are available on the host machine.

**Application and Assets:**
- **`application`** üè¢: Indicates whether the module is a full-fledged application or just an add-on providing extra functionality.
- **`assets`** üì¶: Defines how static files are loaded in various asset bundles, helping to manage resources efficiently.

**Installation and Maintenance:**
- **`installable`** ‚úÖ: Specifies whether the module can be installed via the web interface.
- **`maintainer`** üõ†Ô∏è: The person or entity responsible for maintaining the module. By default, this is assumed to be the author.

**Hooks:**
- **`{pre_init, post_init, uninstall}_hook`** ü™ù: These are special functions that can be executed at different stages of the module‚Äôs lifecycle, such as before installation or after uninstallation. They allow for custom setup or cleanup actions.

With this blueprint in place, your `__manifest__.py` file ensures your module is properly identified, configured, and integrated within the Odoo ecosystem. It‚Äôs the key that unlocks your module‚Äôs potential, declaring its presence and capabilities for all to see.

As you continue your journey in Odoo development, understanding and crafting this `manifest` file will empower you to create robust, well-defined modules.

Just as unit tests safeguard your code, the manifest file declares your module‚Äôs identity and ensures it seamlessly integrates into the Odoo world. üöÄ

### Chapter 2: The Web Controllers üåê

After mastering the art of module `manifests`, our journey in the Odoo development landscape takes us to another critical aspect‚Äî `Web Controllers`. These controllers are the `gatekeepers`, handling incoming `HTTP` requests and directing them to the right `handlers` within the Odoo ecosystem.

#### The Architects of the Web: Controllers üèõÔ∏è

Controllers in Odoo are akin to the conductors of an orchestra, ensuring that every request reaches the right endpoint and is processed correctly. They are created by inheriting from the base `Controller` class and defining routes using the `@route()` decorator.

```python
class MyController(odoo.http.Controller):
    @route('/some_url', auth='public')
    def handler(self):
        return "Hello, World!"
```

This simple piece of code sets up a controller that listens to requests at `/some_url` and responds with "Hello, World!"

#### Extending the Symphony üé∂

Just as the Odoo models can be extended, so can the controllers. If you need to modify the behavior of an existing controller, you can `inherit` from it and override its methods. It's important to `re-decorate` these methods with `@route()` to ensure they remain accessible.

```python
class Extension(MyController):
    @route()
    def handler(self):
        do_before()
        return super(Extension, self).handler()
```

Without the `@route()` decorator, the method becomes unpublished and inaccessible, much like a conductor without a baton.

#### Crafting Routes with Precision üéØ

The `@route()` decorator is the magic wand that maps URLs to controller methods. It supports various parameters to fine-tune its behavior:

- **`route`**: Specifies the URL path(s) this method will handle.
- **`type`**: Determines the request type, either `'json'` or `'http'`.
- **`auth`**: Controls the authentication level required (`'user'`, `'public'`, or `'none'`).
- **`methods`**: Lists the HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) this route accepts.
- **`csrf`**: Enables or disables CSRF protection.
- **`cors`**: Configures CORS settings for cross-origin requests.

These parameters allow you to define routes that are as specific or as flexible as needed, ensuring robust and secure handling of requests.

#### The Unsung Hero: The Request Object ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

At the heart of every HTTP interaction in Odoo is the `request` object. This object wraps around the incoming HTTP request, providing access to deserialized parameters, session management, and more.

It offers several utilities:

- **`update_env`**: Changes the current user or context.
- **`csrf_token`**: Generates a CSRF token for security.
- **`get_http_params`**: Extracts key-value pairs from the query string and form data.

These tools ensure that your controllers can handle requests efficiently and securely.

#### Crafting Responses with Care üéÅ

Returning a response in Odoo can be straightforward or complex, depending on your needs. You can return simple strings for HTML responses, or use helpers like `make_json_response()` for JSON data. The `Response` class is versatile, handling everything from cookies to custom headers.

```python
def make_response(data, headers=None, cookies=None, status=200):
    return Response(data, headers=headers, cookies=cookies, status=status)
```

This flexibility allows your controllers to respond appropriately to any situation, ensuring a smooth user experience.

#### Dispatching Requests: The Gatekeepers üè∞

Odoo uses `dispatchers` to route and handle different types of requests:

- **`HttpDispatcher`**: Handles standard HTTP requests.
- **`JsonRPCDispatcher`**: Manages JSON-RPC calls, supporting named parameters and custom context.

These dispatchers ensure that each request is processed correctly, whether it‚Äôs a simple HTTP call or a complex JSON-RPC interaction.

### Conclusionüï∏Ô∏è

`Web controllers` in Odoo are indispensable, acting as the `backbone` of web interactions. By understanding how to create, extend, and manage these controllers, you unlock the full potential of Odoo's web capabilities.

As we delve deeper into Odoo development, mastering controllers will empower you to build dynamic, responsive, and secure web applications.

With this knowledge in hand, you're now ready to orchestrate your own symphony of web interactions within the Odoo ecosystem. üöÄ
